# Horiseon-web Refactor

Refactored with HTML and CSS

I first fixed all and any indentation needed to amke the code for both the HTML and CSS to look neat and easier to read.

I then fixed the tab links for for the top tabs to drop down to that section when clicked on to learn more about that topic.

Added alt tags to the images.

Fixed a few id tags and div tages to make sure all CSS styling applied to the correct section.
